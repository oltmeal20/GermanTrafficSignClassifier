German Traffic Sign Classifier
By Luke Oltmanns & Ryan Perenboom

For our final project, for Artificial Intelligence, we decided to work with the German Traffic Sign Recognition Dataset (GTSRB) to create and train an image classifier. We selected and trained models, tested their accuracies, analyzed the available metrics, and then leveraged gleaned insight to optimize input parameters to accurately detect and classify an object in imagery. We explored the effects of adding a larger volume of data, narrowed and expanded the breadth of the dataset, and accurately interpret metrics to optimize the accuracy of our final output.
